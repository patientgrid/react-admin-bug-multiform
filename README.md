# Demo project for suspected bug in React Admin RadioButtonGroupInput

Install and run:

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5173/#/posts/1 and:

1. The radio buttons for the first and second record work perfectly.
2. Clicking on the labels works only for the first record, when clicking
   the labels of the second record, the *first records* radio button will 
   change instead of the first one.
